# Data-Science-E-Commerce
E-commerce shipping encompasses receiving and processing orders, picking and packing the purchased product at a warehouse, printing shipping labels, and even managing returns. All the moving pieces create a level of complexity that depends on the types and sizes of products you sell, to which regions you’ll deliver, the delivery options and shipping speeds you choose to offer and more.  Shipping on time has major significance for E-Commerce companies. It helps in increasing the reputation of the company, broadens the relationship with the clients and hence enhances the customers’ confidence and their buying ability and raise the overall profit for the company.  The goal of our project is to determine whether the products are shipped on time or not.
